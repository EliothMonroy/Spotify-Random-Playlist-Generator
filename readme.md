# Create a playlist with random tracks from your saved tracks collection in Spotify.
### This is a python script, if you want to make your own random playlist here are the requirements and steps to follow:
Requirements:
- Spotify Account
- Python 3.x

Steps-to-follow:

1.- First you need to download the 'test.py' file. 

2.- Now, you have to create a playlist in Spotify with at least one track inside and then obtain their playlist_id (you can obtain it by copying the URI (i.e: spotify:user:user_id:playlist:playlist_id)).

3.- Then using pip you have to install spotipy. Like this:

"pip install spotipy"

4.- For setting up spotipy you can do it using this https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest (just remember to set the enviromental variables)

5.- If you have your app on spotify and you have installed spotipy succesfully now you only have to fill the information that 'test.py' needs.

6.- Finally, after you fill it, you can create your random playlist by running:

"python test.py"

**If it is the first time you run the script, it will ask you for a token (just paste the url opened in your browser)**

Just wait some minutes and that's it. Now you have your playlist ready !
